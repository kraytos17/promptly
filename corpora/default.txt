The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The early bird catches the worm.
Fortune favors the bold.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Actions speak louder than words.
Better late than never.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Great minds think alike.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Knowledge is power.
Look before you leap.
Practice makes perfect.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Time is money.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
